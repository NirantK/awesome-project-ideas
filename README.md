## LLM Apps

- **Knowledge Base QA** aka Answer Engines

  - Take any plaintext dataset e.g. State of the Union address and build on top of that 
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3250749/223094577-8126570b-f7a4-48ad-9f77-ff86a8b21161.png)
  - Can use this over Video Subtitles to search and QA over videos as well, by mapping back to source

- **Guided Summarisation/Rewriting**
  
  - Take specific questions which the user might have about a large text dataset e.g. a novel or book and include that in your summary of the piece
  - Pay attention to specific entities and retell the events which happen in a story with attention to that character
  
- **ControlNet + Stable Diffusion for Aethetic Control**
  - Build tooling using [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/) which takes in a set of photos, finetunes a model (LoRA) on a person, detects face and moves it to a new aesthetic e.g. futuristic neon punk, grunge rock, Studio Ghibli. Can also add InstructPix2Pix to give user more control. 
  
- **Text to Code/SQL**

  - Use code understanding to convert use query to SQL or another executable programming language, including Domain Specific Languages
  - Here is an example of the same: [qabot](github.com/hardbyte/qabot)
  
## Text

- **Autonomous Tagging of StackOverflow Questions**
  
  - Make a multi-label classification system that automatically assigns tags for questions posted on a forum such as StackOverflow or Quora.
